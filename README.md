# arduino-project
This is my microprocessors project, its a videogame inspired by flappy bird. This game uses an LCD screen, a joystick and other electronics like resistors and potentiometers. The code used in this project uses the Liquid Crystal Display library.   

Here you will see how I connected the LCD and Joystick:

LCD:

Pin 1 - Ground - Connected to ground

Pin 2 - Vcc - connected to 5V

Pin 3 - Vo - potentiometer 10k

Pin 4 - Rs - digital pin 12 arduino

Pin 5 - RW - Connected to ground

Pin 6 - E -  digital pin 11 arduino

Pin 7 - DB0 - not conected

Pin 8 - DB1 - not conected

Pin 9 - DB2 - not conected

Pin 10 - DB3 - not conected

Pin 11 - DB4 - digital pin 5 arduino

Pin 12 - DB5 - digital pin 4 arduino

Pin 13 - DB6 - digital pin 3 arduino

Pin 14 - DB7 - digital pin 2 arduino

Pin 15 - LED - connected to a 330 ohm resistor at 5v

Pin 16 - LED - Connected to ground

JoyStick:

GND - Connected to the arduino ground

+5v - Connected to the arduino 5v

VRx - Connected to the analog A0 pin from arduino

VRy - Connected to the analog A1 pin from arduino

Sw - Connected to digital pin 7 in arduino
